My final project, I am creating an “All About Me” website. So far, I have set up the basic HTML structure and separated the HTML and CSS files, following good web design practices. The website includes three main pages: the Home page (“cssc104css.html”), the All About Me page (“allaboutme.html”), and the My Likes and Hobbies page (“mylikes.html”). I have also connected my main stylesheet (“cssc104css.css”) and verified that the links between pages work properly
<link rel="stylesheet" href="cssc104css.css">
    <link rel="mylikes" href="mylikes.html">
    <link rel="allaboutme" href="allaboutme.html">

The Home page"cssc104css" includes a short introduction that explains what the website is about and gives visitors an idea of what they will find on the other pages. I also added a small greeting that includes my name. At the bottom of the Home page, I created two buttons that link to the other pages—one for the All About Me section and another for My Likes and Hobbies mylikes.html.




I linked the All About Me page to the original Home page, and I also connected the CSS file for that page. I added a background and formatted the text using the h1 and h2 tags. At first, I had some difficulties changing the colors for the different heading tags (h1, h2, and h3), but I was eventually able to figure it out. Once I got that working, I started adding my information to the page.
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>All About Me</title>
    <link rel ="stylesheet" href ="allaboutme.css"> 

The All About Me page mainly focuses on my personal experiences and life. It includes sections about my experience in school and how things are going so far, an introduction to my current job, and information about my family members and who they are to me. I also included a short section introducing my pet.

<p>Hi there! My name is Xiomara, and I’m so excited you’re here. This page is a little window into who I am, the things I enjoy, and what inspires me. I love sharing my interests, ideas, and the things that make me, me. So take a look around, get to know me better, and enjoy learning a bit about my world!</p>

Recently, I added the writing for the section about my school experience. I did run into some challenges while trying to add pictures to the page. At first, I wasn’t placing the images correctly into the project files, which caused issues with them not showing up or being out of position. I also had trouble centering the pictures on the page instead of having them stuck on one side. Another challenge I faced was trying to link my workplace’s website to the logo image. I really wanted the restaurant’s logo to link directly to their website, but I didn’t know how to do that at first. To solve this, I watched a few tutorial videos and started learning how to correctly link images to external websites. Overall, even though I ran into some issues, I was able to make progress and learn new skills while improving my website.

After finishing my tags for the day, I always make sure to check my files using HTML and CSS validators. This helps ensure that my code is correct and that everything will run smoothly. When I checked my files, I found about six errors, most of which were related to the images and links I hadn’t added properly. After identifying the issues, I went back and fixed them so that my website would function correctly without any major errors.




Overall, I feel confident about the progress I’ve made so far. Each step has helped me learn more about web design, especially in areas like linking pages, styling with CSS, and organizing files correctly. I still have a few sections to finish, but the project is coming together nicely, and I’m proud of the improvements I’ve made along the way.

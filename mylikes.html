<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I like music because it connects to every part of my life. No matter what I’m doing—having fun, working, studying, or just relaxing—music is always there. It helps me express how I feel, even when I can’t find the right words. Some songs make me happy, some make me think, and others just let me feel everything at once. I love that there are so many kinds of music to fit every mood and moment. It’s not just something I listen to—it’s something that keeps me calm, inspired, and alive. 
    Music feels like my way of expressing myself and understanding the world around me.</p>

<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>I’ve always loved shopping—it’s one of my favorite things to do! I especially enjoy picking out clothes for myself, and I have a soft spot for headphones. But what I really love is finding gifts for the people I care about, like my sister, my friends, and even my dog.
     Giving presents just makes me happy! For my friend’s birthday, for example, I got her a bouquet of flowers and some toys of her favorite character, Strawberry Shortcake. Seeing someone’s face light up when they get a gift from me is honestly the best feeling.</p>

<h2>Coloring</h2>
<p>I’ve always loved coloring—it’s something that’s just really fun and a great way to pass the time. It’s also pretty relaxing. I used to have a lot of coloring books, like princess coloring books and My Little Pony ones, and I even enjoyed coloring on my phone. I especially like coloring cute things,
     nothing too crazy or super detailed.</p>

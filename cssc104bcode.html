  <h3>Hi there! My name is Xiomara, and I’m so excited you’re here. This page is a little window into who I am, the things I enjoy, and what inspires me. I love sharing my interests, ideas, and the things that make me, me. So take a look around, get to know me better, and enjoy learning a bit about my world!</h3>
  <hr> 
<p>I’m a 19-year-old college student attending the University of Advancing Technology online. This is my first year, and I’m so excited to begin this new journey! I live in Georgia — it’s a super quiet place, but I really enjoy the peace and calm here. On this page, I’ll be talking about my likes and dislikes, some of the 
  things I enjoy doing, and a few of my favorite hobbies. You’ll also get to learn some cool details about me
   that I think everyone should know. I’m so glad you’re here and can’t wait to share more about who I am!</p>
   <p>by the end I hope you feel like you know me a little better!</p>
